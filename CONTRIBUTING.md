# Contributing to XfinityDeviceUnpauser: Guidelines for Developers, Tinkerers, and End Users

Welcome to XfinityDeviceUnpauser's open-source community! I'm excited to have you on board as we work together to create <add more here>

## Getting Started
Before diving into the contributing guidelines, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with my project:
- Visit the [README.md](./README.md) for an overview of XfinityDeviceUnpauser features and capabilities.
- Review the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) to understand the terms of use.
- Review the [CODE OF CONDUCT](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to understand how to be safe in the community.

## Code Styles Guidelines
To ensure consistency throughout the project, please follow these code styles guidelines:
- **Style Guide**: PyLint & Black for enforcing coding standards.
- **Documentation**: Use comments to document all classes, methods, constructors, and variables. Documentation should be consistently written and informative as to why certain choices are made and the impact.

## Tech Stack
XfinityDeviceUnpauser's tech stack is based on the following dependencies:
- **Module Name**: Utilize <tech> for <purpose>

## Testing
To ensure the codebase remains reliable and maintainable, I follow a rigorous testing approach:
- **Automated Testing**: Employ automated testing with `PyTest` to increase efficiency and reduce manual effort.
- **Unit Testing**: Conduct unit testing for individual components to validate internal logic.

## Performance Attributes
To meet the performance standards, I prioritize:
- **Multithreading**: Utilize multithreading where possible to improve efficiency and responsiveness.
- **Algorithm/Data Structure Refinement**: Continuously refine algorithms and data structures to optimize performance.
- **Regular Updates and Bug Fixes**: Regularly update and fix bugs to maintain performance standards while ensuring security and stability.

## Development Phase
**Build and Deployment**
Deployment Strategy:
A full-release rollout would be employed, where all new features and updates are released simultaneously to the production environment. This approach ensures that users have access to the latest version of the software with each release.

Target Environments:
- **Development**: The primary workspace for developers, where developmental changes are made.
- **Testing**: An automated testing environment, where code is automatically tested after PRs and commits.
- **Production**: The final production environment, where releases are deployed for end-users.

**Automated Build and Deployment Process**
A CI/CD pipeline automates the build and deployment process, reducing errors and increasing efficiency. This includes:
- **PRS**: Pull requests are made into the development branch.
- **Testing**: Once the development for the next release is finished,  the code is tested in the testing branch.
- **Deployment**: Once the testing succeeds and all bugs have been fixed, A PR is made into the production branch and a release is made.

## Infrastructure and Monitoring
The necessary infrastructure includes:
- **Development, Testing, and Production Environments**: Identical configurations to replicate production-like conditions.
- **Regular Backups**: Backups will be created (in the form of zipped files) when running the update script, allowing for manual rollbacks if needed.

## Contributing Guidelines
1. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
2. Make changes in your branch.
3. Commit changes with meaningful commit messages.
4. Push changes to your remote repository.
5. Open a pull request against the development branch.
6. Participate in code reviews and discussions.
7. Follow testing guidelines and run automated tests.

By following these guidelines, we ensure that the project is developed in a collaborative, efficient, and secure manner.
